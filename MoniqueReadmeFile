Who are your team members? Names & surnames. No need to list who did what this time.
	Alexandra Arizmendi and Camila King

What are the modifications you made to the game?
	Minor Mod: Added a score on the top left where 10 points are added each time an enemy is destroyed
	Major Mod: When pressing space, the player shoots red particles that can destroy the enemy while also playing an shooting audio each time

What's the biggest challenge you have so far?
	The coding for the particles whenever you press space and it would kill the enemy. At the beginning it was tricky but once you understand it, you're able to do it.
Will you continue working on this assignment? If yes, what might be some changes you will add later?
I probably wouldn't but I would take what I learned from it and create my own!
