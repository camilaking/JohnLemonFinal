Who are your team members? Names & surnames. No need to list who did what this time.
	Alexandra Arizmendi and Camila King

What are the modifications you made to the game?
	Minor Mod: Added a score on the top left where 10 points are added each time an enemy is destroyed
	Major Mod: When pressing space, the player shoots red particles that can destroy the enemy while a shooting audio plays each time

What's the biggest challenge you have so far?
	- The player footsteps audio was overriding the shooting audio so there was some issues trying to find the right code to allow the shooting audio to actually play when attacking

Will you continue working on this assignment? If yes, what might be some changes you will add later?
	- Don't plan on it
